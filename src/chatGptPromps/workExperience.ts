#1- global guideline
Recommend skipping any three-month period at a company that didn't go well, unless it involved important skills relevant to the position you're applying for.
Also, suggest excluding experience that doesn't apply to the position you're applying for.#
#2- responsibilities guideline
These are the expected responsibilities for the provided role. It is recommended to avoid generic statements like "develop javascript applications",as they won't make the profile stand out among the millions of other developers who make the same claim about themselves.#
#3- key accomplishments
This section should demonstrate the real impact made in the company, such as business impact, revenues, key results, and improved performance indicators. It's crucial to mention what was improved, how it was accomplished, how it was measured, the extent of improvement, and the actions taken to achieve the impact.
Example: Improved my team's efficiency by reducing the cycle time from 2 months to 3 weeks through the promotion of XP practices, pair and group programming, DevOps principles, and an experimentation mindset.#
#4- key accomplishments template
template: Improved <what you improved> by <increasing/reducing> <metric> from <previous value> to <new value>, by <how you did it>#
#5- previous experience
The time and description provided should only include detailed roles up to approximately 10 years ago.#
